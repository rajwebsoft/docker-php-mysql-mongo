# PHP 8 and 7.4 development environment with PHP-FPM, Nginx and MySQL

You need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your server to proceed using this PHP environment.

## Share the Network with two container

```
docker network create shared-network
```


## Running the environment

- Set the MySQL environment variables creating a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file.

- Build the app image with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose build app
```

- When the build is finished, you can run the environment in background mode with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

- To show information about the state of your active services, run:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

- You can use the logs command to check the logs generated by your services:

```bash
docker-compose logs nginx
```

- If you want to pause your Docker Compose environment while keeping the state of all its services, run:

```bash
docker-compose pause
```

- You can then resume your services with:

```bash
docker-compose unpause
```

- To shut down your Docker Compose environment and remove all of its containers, networks, and volumes, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
